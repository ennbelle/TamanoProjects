            <h2>Welcome to CHEM-X!</h2>
            <p>Chem-x is a website dedicated to exploring
                novice chemistry principles. Here you can explore elements and 
                various compounds. Of course, this website is still in development
                and has not reached its full potential. However, we are proud to
                be a useful tool on your journey to becoming a proficient chemist! </p>

            <h3>Explore the Elements</h3>
            <p>Interested in testing your knowledge about the periodic table?
                Check out Explore the Elements! This page allows you to search an
                element by atomic number and find information about its name, chemical symbol,
                and molecular weight.</p>
            <h3>Molecular Weight Calculator</h3>
            <p>The Molecular Weight Calculator allows you to double check a compound's 
                molecular weight. All you have to do is input the compound's formula and calculate!
                NOTE: This page is still a work in progress...</p>
